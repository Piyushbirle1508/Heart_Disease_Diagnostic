# Objective #
Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis Project is to develop a predictive model 
leveraging key patient features to accurately identify and assess the risk of heart 
disease. Through comprehensive analysis of demographic, clinical, and diagnostic 
parameters, the project aims to provide valuable insights into factors contributing to 
cardiovascular health. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance early detection, risk 
stratification, and inform targeted interventions for improved patient outcomes in 
the realm of heart disease
